ML | CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

The challenge is to recognize fraudulent credit card tansactions so that the customers of credit card campanies are no charged for items that did not purchase.
 
CHALLENGES INVOLVED
1. Imbalanced Data i.e most of the transactions(98.8 %) are not fraudulent which makes it really hard for detecting the fraudulent ones.
2. Data availability as the data is modtly private.
3. Miscalassified Data can be another major issue, as not every fraudulent trasactions is caught and reported.

HOW TO TACKLE THE CHALLENGES
1.The model used must be simple and fast enough to detect the anomaly and classify it as fraudulent transactions as quickly as possible.
2.imbalance can be deal with by properly using good methods.
3. A more trustworthu source must be teaken which doublecheck the data atleast for training the model.
4. We can make the model simple and interpretable so that when the scammer adapts to it with just some tweaks we can have a new model up and running to deploy.
